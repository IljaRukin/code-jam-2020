    "You are currently standing on point (0, 0) in your infinite two-dimensional backyard, and you are trying to reach a goal point (X, Y), with integer coordinates, in as few jumps as possible. You must land exactly on the goal point; it is not sufficient to pass over it on a jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you use your Expogo stick to jump, you pick a cardinal direction: north, south, east, or west. The i-th jump with your Expogo stick moves you 2(i-1) units in the chosen direction, so your first jump takes you 1 unit, your second jump takes you 2 units, your third jump takes you 4 units, and so on.\n",

    "Input\n",
    "The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of a single line with two integers X and Y: the coordinates of the goal point.\n",

    "Output\n",
    "For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is IMPOSSIBLE if the goal point cannot be reached. Otherwise, y must be a string of one or more characters, each of which is either N (north), S (south), E (east), or W (west), representing the directions of the jumps that you will make, in order. This sequence of jumps must reach the goal point at the end of the final jump, and it must be as short as possible.\n",
