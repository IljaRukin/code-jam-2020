    "Many terminals use asterisks (*) to signify \"any string\", including the empty string. For example, when listing files matching BASH*, a terminal may list BASH, BASHER and BASHFUL.

    "In this problem, formally, a pattern is a string consisting of only uppercase English letters and asterisks (*), and a name is a string consisting of only uppercase English letters. A pattern p matches a name m if there is a way of replacing every asterisk in p with a (possibly empty) string to obtain m. Notice that each asterisk may be replaced by a different string.\n",
